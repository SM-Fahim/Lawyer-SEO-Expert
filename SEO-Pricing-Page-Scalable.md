*Real data from PI firm owners on marketing spend and results*

**Case Study #1 - Denver PI Firm**: 
- **Spend**: $100,000/month on marketing
- **Results**: 30-40 clients signed monthly
- **Cost per case**: $2,500-$3,300 per signed case

![Law Firm Marketing Reality](/images/reddit-marketing-spend-9k.png)

**Case Study #2 - North Carolina PI Firm**:
- **Spend**: $9,000/month (aiming for $20,000/month)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why should I choose the phased approach over traditional packages?"
**Answer**: Our phased approach eliminates the risk of large upfront investments with uncertain returns. You start with proven quick wins, see results, then reinvest increased revenue into scaling. Most clients find Phase 1 generates enough additional revenue to comfortably fund Phase 2.

### "What if I want to skip Phase 1 and go straight to Phase 2 or 3?"
**Answer**: While possible, we strongly recommend the phased approach because Phase 1 establishes crucial foundations that make Phases 2-3 more effective. However, we can customize a plan that accelerates through phases based on your current digital presence and budget.

### "Can I pause between phases or adjust the timeline?"
**Answer**: Absolutely. Our system is designed for flexibility. You can pause between phases, adjust timelines, or modify services based on your results, seasonal business patterns, or budget considerations.

### "How do you determine pricing within each phase's range?"
**Answer**: Pricing depends on market competition, number of locations, practice areas, and specific services selected. During consultation, we analyze your situation and provide exact pricing based on your market dynamics and growth goals.

### "What happens if I don't see the expected results in Phase 1?"
**Answer**: Our guarantee covers this. If you don't see positive ROI within 6 months, we continue working for free until you do. Additionally, we provide monthly reports showing progress and make strategy adjustments as needed.
