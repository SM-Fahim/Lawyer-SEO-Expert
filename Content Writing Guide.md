# Prompt for content writing

personal_injury_seo_content.md contains a comprehensive content for a page+blog style. the goal is to create a page that ranks. for this, the current best practice is to extend the page content with a very long form blog content, hence it provides so much information that search engines rank them. now, i want you to create another md file but for the keyword **"SEO for bankruptcy lawyers"**. you need to follow the exact structure of the given example, and go beyond that, and highly tailor the  content to personal injury field, otherwise it will be a duplicate content. however, as the example file is 10,600 tokens long, so when creating content for **bankruptcy** field, do this section by section so that you avoid hallucination. also, while writing content for each section, use the research agent to do extensive research such that the content you create is the best in the world with no error and highly relevant for the readers and very informative with tons of sections. be cretive, think harder. note that the lowest font size can be 14px. 


## Feedback

provide content feedback section by section, otherwise the entire content will be changed. 


# UX Design
Fails to create the UX at one go, misses so many sections. If given feedback, starts recreating.
Maybe a better approach is to give it a smaller chunk, then give other sections to include in between sections. 
this way, the context window won't be used up much.
